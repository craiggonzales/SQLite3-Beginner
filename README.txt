SQLite3 Explained

I created a database for a fictional security business: SME Security.

SME Security sells security consulting to SME's. SME Security needs to keep track of 
customers and products. [I also added a table for employees, but that can be extrapolated
later]. 

The Customer table contains the customer name, a link to the product they purchase, and other required details.
The Product table contains the product name, description, and price.

The sme.py runs a JOIN on the customer and product database to pull details, proving beginning ability to query databases.
